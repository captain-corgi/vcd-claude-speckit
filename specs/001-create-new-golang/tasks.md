# Tasks: Employee Management Web Server

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-new-golang/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
**Tech Stack**: Go 1.21+, GraphQL, Gin, Viper, PostgreSQL, Clean Architecture, DDD, TDD

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure (backend API)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract Employee, User, AuditLog entities
   → contracts/: GraphQL schema + contract tests
   → research.md: PostgreSQL, gqlgen, JWT decisions
   → quickstart.md: Test scenarios and validation requirements
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Go modules, PostgreSQL, Docker
   → Tests: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests
   → Core: Domain → Services → API → Middleware
   → Integration: Database → Auth → Logging
   → Polish: Performance, docs, optimization
4. Apply TDD rules:
   → Tests MUST fail before implementation
   → Real dependencies (actual PostgreSQL)
   → Contract → Integration → Unit order
5. Generate 38 numbered tasks with dependency graph
6. Create parallel execution examples
7. Validate: All contracts tested, all entities modeled
```

## TDD Workflow Example
```bash
# Phase 1: Write failing tests (RED)
go test ./tests/contract/...  # MUST ALL FAIL
git add . && git commit -m "feat: write failing contract tests"

# Phase 2: Implement to make tests pass (GREEN)
# Implement domain layer
# Implement repository layer
# Implement service layer
# Implement API layer
go test ./tests/contract/...  # NOW SHOULD PASS
git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement core functionality"

# Phase 3: Refactor (REFACTOR)
# Optimize, improve code quality, add unit tests
git add . && git commit -m "refactor: optimize and add unit tests"
```

## Quickstart Validation
After completing all tasks, the quickstart.md scenarios should work:
1. ✅ PostgreSQL starts with migrations
2. ✅ GraphQL server starts on port 8080
3. ✅ Admin user creation works
4. ✅ JWT authentication functions
5. ✅ Employee CRUD operations work
6. ✅ Data validation prevents invalid operations
7. ✅ Audit logging captures all changes
8. ✅ Integration tests pass

## Notes
- **[P]** tasks = different files, safe for parallel execution
- **TDD Non-negotiable**: Tests MUST fail before implementation
- **Real dependencies**: Use actual PostgreSQL via testcontainers, NOT mocks
- **Constitution compliance**: Follow all clean architecture, DDD, testing principles
- **Verify quickstart.md**: All scenarios should work after implementation
- **Commit after each task**: Small, focused commits with descriptive messages

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All GraphQL operations have contract tests
- [x] All domain entities have models
- [x] Tests come before implementation (TDD)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No conflicting file modifications in [P] tasks
- [x] Follows Clean Architecture and DDD principles
- [x] Uses real dependencies (PostgreSQL, not mocks)

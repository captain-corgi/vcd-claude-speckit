# Feature Specification: Employee Management Web Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-new-golang`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create new golang webserver for employee management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an administrator, I want to manage employee information through a web interface so that I can efficiently add, update, view, and remove employee records.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an employee management system is available, **When** an admin wants to add a new employee, **Then** the system must capture and store employee information
2. **Given** an employee exists in the system, **When** an admin requests to view employee details, **Then** the system must display the employee's complete information
3. **Given** an employee's information needs updating, **When** an admin submits changes, **Then** the system must update the employee record
4. **Given** an employee no longer works for the company, **When** an admin chooses to delete the employee, **Then** the system must remove the employee record
5. **Given** the system contains multiple employees, **When** an admin requests to see all employees, **Then** the system must display a list of all employees

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an employee ID doesn't exist when attempting to update or delete?
- How does system handle duplicate employee entries?
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during operations?
- How does system handle concurrent access to the same employee record?
- What validation occurs for employee data fields (e.g., email format, phone numbers)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow administrators to create new employee records
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow administrators to retrieve existing employee information
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow administrators to update employee information
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow administrators to delete employee records
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a listing of all employees in the system
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate employee data for completeness and correctness
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to employee data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What authentication method should be used?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all employee management operations for audit purposes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of detail is required in audit logs?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle data persistence for employee information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the required data retention policy?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many concurrent users/employees should the system support?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Employee**: Represents an individual working for the company, contains personal and employment information
- **Administrator**: User role with permission to manage employee data
- **Audit Log**: Records of all employee management operations performed in the system

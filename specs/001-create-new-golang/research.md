# Phase 0: Research Findings

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for the Employee Management Web Server feature. Research focused on resolving NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from the feature specification and identifying best practices for the chosen technology stack.

## NEEDS CLARIFICATION Resolution

### Authentication Method (FR-007)

**Decision**: JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with role-based access control
**Rationale**:

- JWT is the industry standard for web API authentication
- Stateless approach fits well with GraphQL APIs
- Role-based access control supports administrator vs regular user roles
- Easy integration with middleware in Gin framework
**Alternatives considered**: Session-based authentication, OAuth2, API keys

### Audit Log Detail Level (FR-008)

**Decision**: Structured logging with operation type, user, timestamp, affected employee, and changed fields
**Rationale**:

- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
- Structured format allows for easy querying and reporting
- Changed fields tracking reduces storage needs while maintaining full visibility
**Alternatives considered**: Simple text logging, full object snapshots, minimal operation logging

### Data Retention Policy (FR-009)

**Decision**: 7-year retention for active employees, 10-year retention for terminated employees
**Rationale**:

- Aligns with typical labor law requirements
- Sufficient for most compliance and legal needs
- Different retention for terminated accounts follows HR best practices
**Alternatives considered**: 1-year, 3-year, indefinite retention

### Scale Requirements (FR-010)

**Decision**: Support up to 10,000 employees and 100 concurrent users
**Rationale**:

- Matches typical small-to-medium enterprise needs
- Provides room for growth while maintaining performance targets
- Aligns with PostgreSQL's capabilities for this use case
**Alternatives considered**: 1,000 employees, 100,000 employees, unlimited scale

## Technology Best Practices

### Go Development Patterns

**Decision**: Clean Architecture with Domain Driven Design
**Rationale**:

- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Domain models represent business logic independently of infrastructure
- Supports TDD and testing practices required by constitution
- Follows Go's idiomatic package structure

### GraphQL Implementation

**Decision**: gqlgen code-first GraphQL server
**Rationale**:

- Code-first approach provides type safety
- Generates resolver interfaces that facilitate TDD
- Integrates well with Gin framework
- Strong community support and active development

### Database Approach

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with GORM ORM
**Rationale**:

- PostgreSQL provides strong data integrity and relational capabilities
- GORM offers type safety while simplifying database operations
- Excellent migration support for schema changes
- Good performance for the expected scale

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Table-driven testing with testcontainers for integration tests
**Rationale**:

- Table-driven testing is idiomatic in Go
- Testcontainers provide real database for integration tests
- Supports the constitution's requirement for real dependencies
- Enables proper RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

### Logging and Observability

**Decision**: Zap logger with structured JSON output
**Rationale**:

- High-performance logging suitable for production
- Structured JSON format enables easy parsing and analysis
- Includes error context and request tracing
- Integrates well with monitoring systems

```

### Data Model Considerations

**Decision**: Single Employee entity with audit logging as separate concerns
**Rationale**:

- Simplifies data access patterns
- Audit logging as cross-cutting concern follows clean architecture
- Supports the constitution's simplicity requirement (no DTOs unless needed)
- Enables easier validation and business rule enforcement

### API Design

**Decision**: GraphQL schema with mutations for all CRUD operations
**Rationale**:

- Single endpoint simplifies client development
- Strong typing reduces errors
- Queries and mutations match user stories exactly
- Enables efficient data retrieval without over-fetching

## Performance and Scaling

### Database Optimization

**Decision**: Appropriate indexing and connection pooling
**Rationale**:

- Supports performance goals of <100ms p95 response time
- Connection pooling improves throughput for concurrent users
- Indexing strategies based on expected query patterns
**Alternatives considered**: Caching layers, read replicas, sharding

### API Optimization

**Decision**: GraphQL query complexity analysis and rate limiting
**Rationale**:

- Prevents abusive queries from impacting performance
- Rate limiting ensures fair usage across concurrent users
- Complexity analysis helps identify performance bottlenecks

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Implementation

**Decision**: JWT middleware with role-based access control
**Rationale**:

- Secure authentication without state management
- Role-based access controls administrator functions
- Integration with GraphQL resolvers via context
**Security considerations**: Token expiration, refresh tokens, secure storage

### Data Validation

**Decision**: Domain-level validation with database constraints
**Rationale**:

- Defense in depth approach
- Domain validation provides clear error messages
- Database constraints ensure data integrity
**Security considerations**: Input sanitization, SQL injection prevention

## Research Conclusion

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items have been resolved with appropriate technical decisions. The chosen stack (Go, GraphQL, PostgreSQL) aligns well with the feature requirements and constitutional principles. The architecture supports TDD, clean code practices, and the performance goals outlined in the specification.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 1 design with confidence that all unknowns have been addressed.
